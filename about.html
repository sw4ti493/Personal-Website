          <h4>Development</h4>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my website!  A nontraditional developer, I started learning to code after already earning a degree in Business Administration.  So basically, I love building things and understanding the business of getting them out to the world!</p>
            <p>I am always looking for opportunities to create amazing things - whether it may be a friend's pet project, a freelance gig, or a full time job.  Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:swati@swati-kumar.com">swati@swati-kumar.com</a> or <a href="mailto:kumar.swati16@gmail.com">kumar.swati16@gmail.com</a> if you think my skill-set might be useful for your project!  </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Writing, Communication, User Experience</h4>
            <p>Before getting started in web development, I spent some time as a digital marketing consultant for several different startups around the country and was able to take the time to understand the importance of easy-to-navigate design, but also the necessity of great writing and communication style for a truly fantastic user experience.</p>
            <p>Along with what I have (and will continue to) learn about development, these prior experiences are a great asset in terms of being intuitive about the best way to create website content for maximum conversion.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Other Interests</h4>
            <p>I believe the best way to become successful in the ever-evolving work force is to adopt proactive autodidactism.  Autodidactism is self-directed learning, and proactively picking up the newest trends and technology within the industry is the prime way, in my opinion, to always have something valuable to put on the table.</p>
            <p>As a part of a few projects in the e-learning industry, I wrote several blog posts about autodidactism that can be found on <a href="http://swati-kumar.com/blog">my blog</a>.</p>
